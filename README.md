This repository contains code to compare traces as per the paper [Active learning of neuron morphology for accurate automated tracing of neurites](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2014.00037/full).

**Terminology**
 - A `Trace` is defined by an adjacency matrix `AM` and corresponding position vectors `r`.
 - A `Trace` can contain many disconnected `Trees`
 - Each `Tree` is indicated in a labeled adjacency matrix with a unique positive integer.
